To connect the widget to your AWeber account, first click AWeber Web Form under the Settings tab on the left of your Wordpress control panel.

On this page, click the link next to "Step 1".

You'll be taken to a page with an authorization code (it will be a long string of characters) - simply highlight it and copy it to your clipboard.

Back in your Wordpress account, just paste the authorization code into the space provided and click the "Make Connection" button.

Once you've installed this widget and connected it to your AWeber account, head over to the Widgets page under Appearance on the left side of your Wordpress dashboard.

Simply drag the widget (it will show up under Available Widgets as "AWeber Web Form") into the widget area in which you'd like your form to appear.

Once the widget is in place, you can choose which form you would like to appear. Expand the AWeber Web Form widget's options by clicking the arrow to its right, then use the drop down menus to choose the list you want to work with, and the web form you'd like to place on your blog.

Then hit the "Save" button to save your changes, and your form will be installed on your blog.
